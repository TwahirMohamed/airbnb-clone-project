# üîê API Security
Securing backend APIs is a critical component of any modern web application. Our project adopts a multi-layered security approach to protect user data, ensure proper access control, and guard against malicious activity. Below are the key security measures implemented:

## Key Security Measures
## Authentication
We implement secure authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) to verify the identity of users before granting access to any protected resource. This ensures only legitimate users can interact with the API.

## Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to restrict what authenticated users can do. For example, admins have broader access than regular users. This prevents unauthorized actions.

## Rate Limiting & Throttling
APIs are protected against abuse (e.g., brute-force attacks or spam) by limiting the number of requests a user can make over a period of time. Tools like Redis and middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) help enforce this.

## Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or XSS. Libraries like Joi or express-validator are used.

## HTTPS Enforcement
All traffic is encrypted using HTTPS to protect sensitive data in transit.

## CORS Policy
Strict CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules are applied to control which domains can interact with the API.

# Why API Security Is Crucial
##Protecting User Data
User credentials, personal information, and session data must be kept safe from unauthorized access and breaches.

##Securing Payments & Transactions
For applications involving financial transactions, robust security is vital to prevent fraud and financial loss.

## Maintaining Service Integrity
Preventing abuse or malicious use helps keep the service reliable and performant for all users.

## Compliance with Legal Standards
Ensuring proper API security helps meet data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) pipelines are essential for automating and streamlining the software development lifecycle.

## What is CI/CD?
* Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. Each change is automatically tested and verified to catch issues early.

* Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) automates the process of deploying applications to staging or production environments after passing tests and validations.

## Why CI/CD Is Important
* Faster Development Cycles
Automates repetitive tasks, allowing teams to release new features and fixes more frequently.

* Improved Code Quality
Automated testing ensures each commit meets quality standards before it‚Äôs merged or deployed.

* Reduced Manual Errors
Automation minimizes the risk of human error in build and deployment processes.

* Rapid Feedback
Developers get immediate feedback on their changes, making debugging and iteration quicker.

## Tools Used
1. GitHub Actions ‚Äì Automates CI workflows, such as running tests on every pull request or deploying on merge.

2. Docker ‚Äì Containerizes the application, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

3. Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry ‚Äì Hosts and manages Docker images.

4. AWS / Heroku / Vercel ‚Äì Platforms that can be used for automated deployments.
